# My-Viz-Project-FIFA

This project is a collection of visualizations that I created using datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/. I downloaded three different DataFrames and merged some of them to create the final product. The code for each visualization is included in the project, as well as the separate dataframes.

Working on this project was an incredibly enjoyable experience for me. I learned how to merge different dataframes using existing columns, but also had to clean and sort the data before doing so. Creating visualizations using different colors, plots, and graphs was also a lot of fun. However, with these large datasets, there was a lot to explore and analyze.

In this project, our goal was to present our findings within a 5-minute presentation, so my analyses are based on a short timeframe. I focused on a theme that I have always been passionate about, which made the project even more enjoyable for me.

We had three days to complete the project, which was a great experience in time management. Please feel free to contact me if you have any insights, questions, or feedback.
